abstract = {The near-infrared spectrometer on board the Japanese Hayabusa spacecraft found a variation of more than 10\% in albedo and absorption band depth in the surface reflectance of asteroid 25143 Itokawa. Spectral shape over the 1-micrometer absorption band indicates that the surface of this body has an olivine-rich mineral assemblage potentially similar to that of LL5 or LL6 chondrites. Diversity in the physical condition of Itokawa's surface appears to be larger than for other S-type asteroids previously explored by spacecraft, such as 433 Eros.},

abstract = {We present a new iterative method for probabilistic clustering of data. Given clusters, their centers, and the distances of data points from these centers, the probability of cluster membership at any point is assumed to depend on its distances from all centers. We state this assumption as a principle that probability is inversely proportional to distance. The method is based on the above principle, and on the joint distance function,a measure of distance from all cluster centers, that evolves during the iterations, and captures the data in its low contours. At each iteration, the distances (Euclidean, Mahalanobis, etc.) from the cluster centers are computed for all data points, and the centers are updated as stationary points of the joint distance function. The initial centers are arbitrary and computations stop when the centers stop moving. The method is simple, fast (requiring a small number of cheap iterations) and gives a high percentage of correct classifications. It converges to the true cluster centers for all initial solutions, and is not sensitive to outliers.},

@book{Bohm2006,
abstract = {How do we find a natural clustering of a real world point set, which contains an unknown number of clusters with different shapes, and which may be contaminated by noise? Most clustering algorithms were designed with certain as- sumptions (Gaussianity), they often require the user to give input parameters, and they are sensitive to noise. In this pa- per, we propose a robust framework for determining a nat- ural clustering of a given data set, based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The proposed frame- work, Robust Information-theoretic Clustering (RIC),isor- thogonal to any known clustering algorithm: given a pre- liminary clustering, RIC purifies these clusters from noise, and adjusts the clusterings such that it simultaneously de- termines the most natural amount and shape (subspace) of the clusters. Our RIC method can be combined with any clustering technique ranging from K-means and K-medoids to advanced methods such as spectral clustering. In fact, RIC is even able to purify and improve an initial coarse clustering, even if we start with very simple methods such as grid-based space partitioning. Moreover, RIC scales well with the data set size. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real world data sets validate the proposed RIC frame- work.},

abstract = {Subpixel detection is a challenging problem in hyperspectral imagery analysis. Since the target size is smaller than the size of a pixel, detection algorithms must rely solely on spectral information. A number of different algorithms have been developed over the years to accomplish this task, but most detectors have taken either a purely statistical or a physics-based approach to the problem. We present two new hybrid detectors that take advantage of these approaches by modeling the background using both physics and statistics. Results demonstrate improved performance over the well known AMSD and ACE subpixel algorithms in experiments that include multiple targets, images, and area types--especially when dealing with weak targets in complex backgrounds.},

abstract = {The maximum size of impact craters on finite bodies marks the largest impact that can occur short of impact induced disruption of the body. Recently attention has started to focus on large craters on small bodies such as asteroids and rocky and icy satellites. Here the large crater on the recently imaged asteroid (2867) Steins (with crater diameter to mean asteroid radius ratio of 0.79) is shown to follow a limit set by other similar sized bodies with moderate macroporosity (i.e. fractured asteroids). Thus whilst large, the crater size is not novel, nor does it requires Steins to possess an extremely large porosity. In one of the components of the binary asteroid (90) Antiope there is the recently reported presence of an extremely large depression, possibly a crater, with depression diameter to mean asteroid radius ratio of (1.4 – 1.62). This is consistent with the maximum size of a crater expected from previous observations of very porous rocky bodies (i.e. rubble-pile asteroids). Finally, a relationship between crater diameter (normalised to body radius) is proposed as a function of body porosity which suggests that the doubling of porosity between fractured asteroids and rubble-pile asteroids, nearly doubles the size (D/R value) of the largest crater sustainable on a rocky body.},

@article{Byrne2013,
abstract = {[1] In contrast to other terrestrial planets, Mercury does not possess a great variety of volcanic features, its history of volcanism instead largely manifest by expansive smooth plains. However, a set of landforms at high northern latitudes on Mercury resembles surface flow features documented on Earth, the Moon, Mars, and Venus. The most striking of such landforms are broad channels that host streamlined islands and that cut through the surrounding intercrater plains. Together with narrower, more sinuous channels, coalesced depressions, evidence for local flooding of intercrater plains by lavas, and a first-order analysis of lava flow rates, we find that the broad channels define an assemblage of flow features formed by the overland flow of, and erosion by, voluminous, high-temperature, low-viscosity lavas. This interpretation is consistent with compositional data suggesting that substantial portions of Mercury's crust are composed of magnesian, iron-poor ultramafic lithologies. Moreover, the proximity of this partially flooded assemblage to extensive volcanic plains raises the possibility that the formation of these flow features may preface total inundation of an area by lavas emplaced in a flood mode, and that they escaped complete burial only due to a waning magmatic supply. Finally, that these broad channels on Mercury are volcanic in nature yet resemble outflow channels on Mars, which are commonly attributed to catastrophic water floods, implies that aqueous activity is not a prerequisite for the formation of such distinctive landforms on any planetary body.},

abstract = {This paper is about a curious phenomenon. Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component. Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the L1 norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces.},

abstract = {abstract Dwarf-planet (1) Ceres is one of the two targets, along with (4) Vesta, that will be studied by the NASA Dawn spacecraft via imaging, visible and near-infrared spectroscopy, and gamma-ray and neutron spec- troscopy. While Ceres’ visible and near-infrared disk-integrated spectra have been well characterized, lit- tle has been done about quantifying spectral variations over the surface. Any spectral variation would give us insights on the geographical variation of the composition and/or the surface age. The only work so far was that of Rivkin and Volquardsen ([2010], Icarus 206, 327) who reported rotationally-resolved spectroscopic (disk-integrated) observations in the 2.2–4.0 lm range; their observations showed evi- dence for a relatively uniform surface. Here, we report disk-resolved observations of Ceres with SINFONI (ESO VLT) in the 1.17–1.32 lm and 1.45–2.35 lm wavelength ranges. The observations were made under excellent seeing conditions (0.600), allowing us to reach a spatial resolution of ?75 km on Ceres’ surface. We do not find any spectral vari- ation above a 3\% level, suggesting a homogeneous surface at our spatial resolution. Slight variations (about 2\%) of the spectral slope are detected, geographically correlated with the albedo markings reported from the analysis of the HST and Keck disk-resolved images of Ceres (Li et al. [2006], Icarus 182, 143; Carry et al. [2008], Astron. Astrophys. 478, 235). Given the lack of constraints on the surface composition of Ceres, however, we cannot assert the causes of these variations.},

abstract = {The composition of the ancient martian crust is a key ingredient in deciphering the environment and evolution of early Mars. We present an analysis of the composition of large craters in the martian northern plains based on data from spaceborne imaging spectrometers. Nine of the craters have excavated assemblages of phyllosilicates from ancient, Noachian crust buried beneath the plains' cover. The phyllosilicates are indistinguishable from those exposed in widespread locations in the southern highlands, demonstrating that liquid water once altered both hemispheres of Mars.},

In this article we illustrate some basic features of error bars and explain how they can help communicate data and assist correct interpretation. Error bars may show confidence intervals, standard errors, standard deviations, or other quantities. Different types of error bars give quite different information, and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent. We suggest eight simple rules to assist with effective use and interpretation of error bars.},

abstract = {This work focuses on detecting outliers within large and very large datasets using a computationally efficient procedure. The algorithm uses Tukey’s biweight function applied on the dataset to filter out the effects of extreme values for obtaining appropriate location and scale estimates. Robust Mahalanobis distances for all data points are calculated using these location and scale estimates. A suitable rejection point for the outliers is determined by a separation boundary obtained using non-parametric density estimation by Parzen window where the probability density curve of the robust Mahalanobis distances descends and then again ascends for outlying distances. This procedure demonstrates good success at identifying outliers even in cases where data is highly skewed and overlapping, compared to established statistical outlier detection methods for both univariate and multivariate data where the underlying distribution needs to be known.},

abstract = {The mineralogy of Vesta, based on data obtained by the Dawn spacecraft's visible and infrared spectrometer, is consistent with howardite-eucrite-diogenite meteorites. There are considerable regional and local variations across the asteroid: Spectrally distinct regions include the south-polar Rheasilvia basin, which displays a higher diogenitic component, and equatorial regions, which show a higher eucritic component. The lithologic distribution indicates a deeper diogenitic crust, exposed after excavation by the impact that formed Rheasilvia, and an upper eucritic crust. Evidence for mineralogical stratigraphic layering is observed on crater walls and in ejecta. This is broadly consistent with magma-ocean models, but spectral variability highlights local variations, which suggests that the crust can be a complex assemblage of eucritic basalts and pyroxene cumulates. Overall, Vesta mineralogy indicates a complex magmatic evolution that led to a differentiated crust and mantle.},

abstract = {We investigated the origin of unusual pitted terrain on asteroid Vesta, revealed in images from the Dawn spacecraft. Pitted terrain is characterized by irregular rimless depressions found in and around several impact craters, with a distinct morphology not observed on other airless bodies. Similar terrain is associated with numerous martian craters, where pits are thought to form through degassing of volatile-bearing material heated by the impact. Pitted terrain on Vesta may have formed in a similar manner, which indicates that portions of the surface contain a relatively large volatile component. Exogenic materials, such as water-rich carbonaceous chondrites, may be the source of volatiles, suggesting that impactor materials are preserved locally in relatively high abundance on Vesta and that impactor composition has played an important role in shaping the asteroid's geology.},

abstract = {We propose a new method to retrieve the optical depth of Martian aerosols (AOD) from OMEGA and CRISM hyperspectral imagery at a reference wavelength of 1 micron. Our method works even if the underlying surface is completely made of minerals, corresponding to a low contrast between surface and atmospheric dust, while being observed at a fixed geometry. Minimizing the effect of the surface reflectance properties on the AOD retrieval is the second principal asset of our method. The method is based on the parametrization of the radiative coupling between particles and gas determining, with local altimetry, acquisition geometry, and the meteorological situation, the absorption band depth of gaseous CO2. Because the last three factors can be predicted to some extent, we can define a new parameter beta that expresses specifically the strength of the gas-aerosols coupling while directly depending on the AOD. Combining estimations of beta and top of the atmosphere radiance values extracted from the observed spectra within the CO2 gas band at 2 microns, we evaluate the AOD and the surface reflectance by radiative transfer inversion. One should note that practically beta can only be estimated for surfaces spectrally dominated by minerals and/or H2O ice. Validation of the proposed method shows that it is reliable if two conditions are fulfilled: (i) the observation conditions provide an airmass that is large enough >3.5 (ii) the aerosol are vertically well mixed in the atmosphere. Experiments conducted on OMEGA nadir looking observations as well as CRISM EPF produce very satisfactory results. Finally in a companion paper the method is applied to monitoring atmospheric dust spring activity at high southern latitudes on Mars using OMEGA.},

@article{Edwards2013,
abstract = {The diversity of investigations of planetary surfaces, especially Mars, using in situ instrumentation over the last decade is unprecedented in the exploration history of our solar system. The style of instrumentation that landed spacecraft can support is dependent on several parameters, including mass, power consumption, instrument complexity, cost, and desired measurement type (e.g., chemistry, mineralogy, petrology, morphology, etc.), all of which must be evaluated when deciding an appropriate spacecraft payload. We present a laboratory technique for a microscopic emission and reflectance spectrometer for the analysis of martian analog materials as a strong candidate for the next generation of in situ instruments designed to definitively assess sample mineralogy and petrology while preserving geologic context. We discuss the instrument capabilities, signal and noise, and overall system performance. We evaluate the ability of this instrument to quantitatively determine sample mineralogy, including bulk mineral abundances. This capability is greatly enhanced. Whereas the number of mineral components observed from existing emission spectrometers is high (often >5 to 10 depending on the number of accessory and alteration phases present), the number of mineral components at any microscopic measurement spot is low (typically <2 to 3). Since this style of instrument is based on a long heritage of thermal infrared emission spectrometers sent to orbit (the thermal emission spectrometer), sent to planetary surfaces [the mini-thermal emission spectrometers (mini-TES)], and evaluated in laboratory environments (e.g., the Arizona State University emission spectrometer laboratory), direct comparisons to existing data are uniquely possible with this style of instrument. The ability to obtain bulk mineralogy and atmospheric data, much in the same manner as the mini-TESs, is of significant additional value and maintains the long history of atmospheric monitoring for Mars. Miniaturization of this instrument has also been demonstrated, as the same microscope objective has been mounted to a flight-spare mini-TES. Further miniaturization of this instrument is straightforward with modern electronics, and the development of this instrument as an arm-mounted device is the end goal.},

abstract = {Simulations of complex scientific phenomena involve the execution of massively parallel computer programs. These simulation programs generate large-scale data sets over the spatio-temporal space. Modeling such massive data sets is an essential step in helping scientists discover new information from their computer simulations. In this paper, we present a simple but effective multivariate clustering algorithm for large-scale scientific simulation data sets. Our algorithm utilizes the cosine similarity measure to cluster the field variables in a data set. Field variables include all variables except the spatial (x, y, z) and temporal (time) variables. The exclusion of the spatial dimensions is important since “similar” characteristics could be located (spatially) far from each other. To scale our multivariate clustering algorithm for large-scale data sets, we take advantage of the geometrical properties of the cosine similarity measure. This allows us to reduce the modeling time from O(n2) to O(n g(f(u))), where n is the number of data points, f(u) is a function of the user-defined clustering threshold, and g(f(u)) is the number of data points satisfying f(u). We show that on average g(f(u)) is much less than n. Finally, even though spatial variables do not play a role in building clusters, it is desirable to associate each cluster with its correct spatial region. To achieve this, we present a linking algorithm for connecting each cluster to the appropriate nodes of the data set’s topology tree (where the spatial information of the data set is stored). Our experimental evaluations on two large- scale simulation data sets illustrate the value of our multivariate clustering and linking algorithms},

abstract = {The present article proposes an approach to analyze the photometric properties of the surface materials from multi-angle observations acquired by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) on-board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. We estimate photometric parameters using Hapke model in a Bayesian inversion framework. This work also represents a validation of the atmospheric correction provided by the Multi-angle Approach for Retrieval of Surface Reflectance from CRISM Observations (MARS-ReCO) proposed in the companion article.The latter algorithm retrieves photometric curves of surface materials in reflectance units after removing the aerosol contribution. This validation is done by comparing the estimated photometric parameters to those obtained from in situ measurements by Panoramic Camera instrument at the Mars Exploration Rover (MER)-Spirit and MER-Opportunity landing sites. Consistent photometric parameters with those from in situ measurements are found, demonstrating that MARS-ReCO gives access to accurate surface reflectance. Moreover the assumption of a non-Lambertian surface as included in MARS-ReCO is shown to be significantly more precise to estimate surface photometric properties from space in comparison to methods based on a Lambertian surface assumption. In the future, the presented method will allow us to map from orbit the surface bidirectional reflectance and the related photometric parameters in order to characterize the Martian surface.},

@article{Forget2012,
abstract = {On the basis of geological evidence, it is often stated that the early martian climate was warm enough for liquid water to flow on the surface thanks to the greenhouse effect of a thick atmosphere. We present 3D global climate simulations of the early martian climate performed assuming a faint young sun and a CO2 atmosphere with pressure between 0.1 and 7 bars. The model includes a detailed radiative transfer model using revised CO2 gas collision induced absorption properties, and a parameterisation of the CO2 ice cloud microphysical and radiative properties. A wide range of possible climates is explored by using various values of obliquities, orbital parameters, cloud microphysic parameters, atmospheric dust loading, and surface properties. Unlike on present day Mars, for pressures higher than a fraction of a bar, surface temperatures vary with altitude because of the adiabatic cooling and warming of the atmosphere when it moves vertically. In most simulations, CO2 ice clouds cover a major part of the planet but greenhouse effect does not exceed +15 K. We find that a CO2 atmosphere could not have raised the annual mean temperature above 0\{$\backslash$deg\}C anywhere on the planet. The collapse of the atmosphere into permanent CO2 ice caps is predicted for pressures higher than 3 bar, or conversely at pressure lower than one bar if the obliquity is low enough. Summertime diurnal mean surface temperatures above 0\{$\backslash$deg\}C (a condition which could have allowed rivers to form) are predicted for obliquity larger than 40\{$\backslash$deg\} at high latitudes but not in locations where most valley networks are observed. In the absence of other warming mechanisms, our climate model results are thus consistent with a cold early Mars scenario in which non climatic mechanisms must occur to explain the evidence for liquid water. In a companion paper by Wordsworth et al., we simulate the hydrological cycle on such a planet.},

The global average methane mixing ratio is found to be 10 +/- 5 parts per billion by volume (ppbv). However, the mixing ratio varies between 0 and 30 ppbv over the planet. The source of methane could be either biogenic or nonbiogenic, including past or present subsurface microorganisms, hydrothermal activity, or cometary impacts.},

@article{Fraser2010,
abstract = {We have performed an ecliptic survey of the Kuiper belt, with an areal coverage of 8.9 square degrees to a 50\% limiting magnitude of r'\_sloan=24.7, and have detected 88 Kuiper belt objects, roughly half of which received follow-up one to two months after detection. Using this survey data alone, we have measured the luminosity function of the Kuiper belt, thus avoiding any biases that might come from the inclusion of other observations. We have found that the Cold population defined as having inclinations less than 5° has a luminosity function slope $\alpha$\_cold=0.82±0.23, and is different from the Hot population, which has inclinations greater than 5° and a luminosity function slope $\alpha$\_Hot=0.35±0.21. As well, we have found that those objects closer than 38 AU have virtually the same luminosity function slope as the Hot population. This result, along with similar findings of past surveys demonstrates that the dynamically cold Kuiper belt objects likely have a steep size distribution, and are unique from all of the excited populations which have much shallower distributions. This suggests that the dynamically excited population underwent a different accretion history and achieved a more evolved state of accretion than the cold population. As well, we discuss the similarities of the Cold and Hot populations with the size distributions of other planetesimal populations. We find that while the Jupiter family comets and the scattered disk exhibit similar size distributions, a power-law extrapolation to small sizes for the scattered disk cannot account for the observed influx of comets. As well, we have found that the Jupiter Trojan and Hot populations cannot have originated from the same parent popuation, a result that is difficult to reconcile with scattering models similar to the NICE model. We conclude that the similarity between the size distributions of the Cold population and the Jupiter Trojan population is a striking coincidence.},

abstract = {Our ability to accumulate large, complex (multivariate) data sets has far exceeded our ability to effectively process them in search of patterns, anomalies, and other interesting features. Conventional multivariate visualization techniques generally do not scale well with respect to the size of the data set. The focus of this paper is on the interactive visualization of large multivariate data sets based on a number of novel extensions to the parallel coordinates display technique. We develop a multiresolutional view of the data via hierarchical clustering, and use a variation on parallel coordinates to convey aggregation information for the resulting clusters. Users can then navigate the resulting structure until the desired focus region and level of detail is reached, using our suite of navigational and filtering tools. We describe the design and implementation of our hierarchical parallel coordinates system which is based on extending the XmdvTool system. Lastly, we show examples of the tools and techniques applied to large (hundreds of thousands of records) multivariate data sets.},

abstract = {We examine the importance of localized volcanism in resurfacing on Venus by analyzing the results of geologic mapping of a 12° × 12° area at the full resolution of Magellan SAR data. Resurfacing due to corona-, ridge-, and small volcano-related volcanism accounts for 27\%, 6\%, and 10\% respectively of the mapped area. Mapping at the resolution of Magellan data, rather than a regional scale, gives corona-related flow unit areas that can differ individually by almost an order of magnitude, with a total increase of 28\%, and more than three times as many identifiable units. A total of 2919 small volcanoes or vents less than 10 km in diameter were identified in the F-Map, with a mean diameter of 1.59 (s.d. = 1.08) km and densities of up to 36 small volcanoes per 50 km2. Taken together, coronae, ridge eruptions, and small volcanoes probably make a significant contribution to resurfacing on Venus.},

@article{Gupta2010,
abstract = {Numerical simulations have been performed to understand the planetary differentiation of Vesta and other differentiated asteroids. The short-lived nuclides 26Al and 60Fe were used as the heat sources for the differentiation of asteroids of sizes 20–270 km. The essential aim was to simulate the two proposed differentiation scenarios associated with the formation of the basaltic achondrites. One of these scenarios deals with their origin by partial melting of silicates. The other scenario involves the origin of basalts from the residual melt left subsequent to crystallization in a convective and cooling magma ocean. The core-mantle differentiation in both the scenarios was commenced subsequent to 40\% silicate melting. The partial melt scenario seems to contradict the general trend in the chronological sequence of core-mantle and mantle-crust differentiations observed in various differentiated meteorites unless the irons meteorite parent bodies differentiated rapidly compared to prolonged accretion and differentiation of distinct parent bodies of achondrites. Even though the geochemical records of siderophile elements in eucrites favor the residual melt scenario, based on our simulations it is difficult to rapidly and globally cool the magma oceans to produce residual basaltic melts subsequent to crystallization within initial ∼10 million years. This is in contradiction with the chronological records of the basalts that suggest their early origin. In order to make this scenario viable by invoking rapid and global cooling of the magma ocean it would be essential to substantially remove the insulating crust of the planetesimal by continuous bombardment of small planetesimals in the early solar system.},

abstract = {The Mariner 9 infrared spectroscopy experiment has provided goodquality spectra of many areas of Mars, predominantly in the southern hemisphere. Large portions of the thermal emission spectra are significantly affected by dust with a silicon oxide content approximately corresponding to that of an intermediate igneous rock, thus implying that Mars has undergone substantial geochemical differentiation. Derived temperature profiles indicate a warm daytime upper atmosphere with a strong warming over the south polar cap. Atmospheric water vapor is clearly observed over the south polar area and less strongly over other regions.},

abstract = {A lava channel identified on the wall of an Elysium Planitia impact crater is investigated to identify the dominant erosion mechanism, mechanical vs. thermal, acting during channel formation. Observations of channel morphology are used to supplement analytical models of lava channel formation in order to calculate the duration of channel formation, the velocity of the lava flowing through the channel, and the erosion rate in each erosion regime considered. Results demonstrate that the channel observed in the Elysium Planitia impact crater formed primarily due to mechanical erosion. In a more general sense, results of this study suggest that lava channels can form primarily due to thermal erosion in the presence of more gradual slopes and more consolidated substrates whereas lava channels can form primarily due to mechanical erosion in the presence of more energetic flows on steeper slopes and more poorly consolidated substrates. Therefore, both erosion regimes must be considered when analyzing origins of eroded lava channels that cut through strata of different strengths.},

@article{Ioannidis2005,
abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {In the absence of a firm link between individual meteorites and their asteroidal parent bodies, asteroids are typically characterized only by their light reflection properties, and grouped accordingly into classes. On 6 October 2008, a small asteroid was discovered with a flat reflectance spectrum in the 554-995 nm wavelength range, and designated 2008 TC(3) (refs 4-6). It subsequently hit the Earth. Because it exploded at 37 km altitude, no macroscopic fragments were expected to survive. Here we report that a dedicated search along the approach trajectory recovered 47 meteorites, fragments of a single body named Almahata Sitta, with a total mass of 3.95 kg. Analysis of one of these meteorites shows it to be an achondrite, a polymict ureilite, anomalous in its class: ultra-fine-grained and porous, with large carbonaceous grains. The combined asteroid and meteorite reflectance spectra identify the asteroid as F class, now firmly linked to dark carbon-rich anomalous ureilites, a material so fragile it was not previously represented in meteorite collections.},

abstract = {Images of theMoon at 32 wavelengths from 350 to 2450 nm have been obtained from a dedicated observatory during the bright half of each month over a period of several years. The ultimate goal is to develop a spectral radiance model of the Moon with an angular resolution and radiometric accuracy appropriate for calibration of Earth-orbiting spacecraft. An empirical model of irradiance has been developed that treats phase and libration explicitly, with absolute scale founded on the spectra of the starVega and returned Apollo samples.Aselected set of 190 standard stars are observed regularly to provide nightly extinction correction and long-term calibration of the observations. The extinctionmodel is wavelength-coupled and based on the absorption coefficients of a number of gases and aerosols. The empirical irradiance model has the same form at each wavelength, with 18 coefficients, eight ofwhich are constant acrosswavelength, for a total of 328 coefficients. Over 1000 lunar observations are fitted at each wavelength; the average residual is less than 1\%. The irradiance model is actively being used in lunar calibration of several spacecraft instruments and can track sensor response changes at the 0.1\% level.},

@article{Kostiuk2010,
abstract = {The Cassini Huygens mission provides a unique opportunity to combine ground-based and spacecraft investigations to increase our understanding of chemical and dynamical processes in Titan’s atmosphere. Spectroscopic measurements from both vantage points enables retrieving global wind structure, temperature structure, and atmospheric composition. An updated analysis of Titan data obtained with the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center’s Infrared Heterodyne Spectrometer (IRHS) and Heterodyne Instrument for Planetary Wind And Composition (HIPWAC) prior to and during the Cassini Huygens mission is compared to retrievals from measurements with the Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS). IRHS/HIPWAC results include the first direct stratospheric wind measurements on Titan, constraints on stratospheric temperature, and the study of atmospheric molecular composition. These results are compared to CIRS retrievals of wind and temperature profile from thermal mapping data and ethane abundance at 10–15° South latitude, near the equatorial region. IRHS/HIPWAC wind results are combined with other direct techniques, stellar occultation measurements, and CIRS results to explore seasonal variability over nearly one Titan year and to provide an empirical altitude profile of stratospheric winds, varying from \~{}50 to 210 m/s prograde. The advantage of fully resolved line spectra in species abundance measurements is illustrated by comparing the possible effect on retrieved ethane abundance by blended spectral features of other molecular constituents, e.g., acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4), allene (C3H4), and propane (C3H8), that overlap the $\nu$9 band of ethane, and are not resolved at lower spectral resolution. IR heterodyne spectral resolution can discriminate weak spectral features that overlap the $\nu$9 band of ethane, enabling ethane lines alone to be used to retrieve abundance. Titan’s stratospheric mean ethane mole fraction (8.6±3 ppmv) retrieved from IRHS/HIPWAC emission line profiles (resolving power $\lambda$$\Delta$$\lambda$\~{}106) is compared to past values obtained from lower resolution spectra and from CIRS measurements (resolving power $\lambda$$\Delta$$\lambda$\~{}2×103) and more compatible recent analysis. Results illustrate how high spectral resolution ground-based studies complement the spectral and spatial coverage and resolution of moderate spectral resolution space-borne spectrometers.},

@article{Kuppers2014,
abstract = {The 'snowline' conventionally divides Solar System objects into dry bodies, ranging out to the main asteroid belt, and icy bodies beyond the belt. Models suggest that some of the icy bodies may have migrated into the asteroid belt. Recent observations indicate the presence of water ice on the surface of some asteroids, with sublimation a potential reason for the dust activity observed on others. Hydrated minerals have been found on the surface of the largest object in the asteroid belt, the dwarf planet (1) Ceres, which is thought to be differentiated into a silicate core with an icy mantle. The presence of water vapour around Ceres was suggested by a marginal detection of the photodissociation product of water, hydroxyl (ref. 12), but could not be confirmed by later, more sensitive observations. Here we report the detection of water vapour around Ceres, with at least 10(26) molecules being produced per second, originating from localized sources that seem to be linked to mid-latitude regions on the surface. The water evaporation could be due to comet-like sublimation or to cryo-volcanism, in which volcanoes erupt volatiles such as water instead of molten rocks.},

abstract = {We present the results of shock induced silicate vapor- ization experiments using laser driven hypervelocity pro- jectiles. In situ spectroscopic observations of shock heated quartz and diopside were conducted. We observed both atomic emission lines and blackbody continuum. Because emission lines occur only in a gas phase, this observation indicates that the incipient vaporization of silicates actually occurs at >10 km/s. We estimated the peak shock tempera- tures from the blackbody spectra. The obtained results sug- gest that the temperature dependence of the isochoric specific heat Cv depends rather strongly on material at extremely high pressures. Such difference in Cv dependence on tem- perature will influence the impact vaporization efficiency. Thus, investigation on the Cv of the other major silicates is necessary for understanding impact‐related phenomena. Furthermore, the observed high intensity of emission lines shows the possibility that a variety of the thermodynamic variables of expanding silicate vapor can be measured with a higher speed spectrometer.},

A model of Titan’s aerosols based on measurements made inside the atmosphere. Planet. Space Sci., 56, 669-707]. We set the mass production of aerosols in the thermosphere to 3×10-14 g cm-2 s-1 and follow the evolution of the particles due to coagulation, sedimentation and atmospheric mixing. We use the observed aerosol phase functions at 100 km to constrain the particle’s charge density to 15 e/$\mu$m. With this charge density, the microphysical model predictions for the number of monomers, and the particle size and density, are in good agreement with the DISR measurements. In addition, we derive a new refractive index for the aerosols based on the single scattering albedo inferred from DISR measurements. The imaginary index is larger than previous estimates based on laboratory analogs, with an increasing absorption toward the near-IR. Our simulation provides a good description of the particle properties above 80 km, but we find that condensation effects must be included in order to interpret aerosol characteristics at lower altitudes.},

abstract = {Thirty tektites from East Asia (including Wenchang and Penglei of Hainan Island, Maoming of Guandong, China; Khon-Kaen of Thailand; Bao Loc of Vietnam; Rizal of Luzon, Philippines) have been analyzed for major and trace element contents and Rb-Sr isotopic compositions. All the samples studied are splash form tektites. The trace element ratios Ba/Rb (avg. 3.74), Th/Sm (avg. 2.31), Sm/Sc (avg. 0.43), Th/Sc (avg. 0.99) and the rare earth elements (REE) contents of tektites studied are similar to the average upper continental crust. The chemical data of tektites in this study indicate that they were derived from similar target rocks which may be related to post-Archean upper crustal materials. The tektites from East Asia have high positive $\epsilon$Sr(0) values-ranging from 164.2 to 198.6, indicating that they were not dominantly derived from recent young sediments, such as soil or loess. The Ar-Ar ages (736.8 ± 55.5∼814.6 ± 24.4 ka) of tektites of the present study are consistent with the age of other Australasian tektites, which indicates that all Australasian tektites were derived from a single impact event. Previous studies (Koeberl, 1992; Blum et al., 1992; Schnetzler, 1992) and the present chemical data suggest that these tektites are the result of melting at a single site, which is most probably located in the southern part of the Thailand-Laos border. Mixing calculations based on the model suggested by Ho and Chen (1996) for various amounts and combinations of target rocks indicate that the best fit for East Asia tektites is a mixture of 61\% greywacke, 32\% sandstone and 7\% shale.},

abstract = {The Mars atmosphere responds by radiative and convective heating to surface temperature changes in a time-scale of the order of one day. This is about 50 times as fast as the corresponding response on the earth. As a consequence, the mean wind distribution is under strong solar control but may be modified by latent heat release in CO(2) condensation and by the mass flow required to balance such condensation. Unstable eddies, analogous to terrestrial cyclones, are to be expected in all seasons except summer. The thermally driven tides are likely to be strong on Mars, but a detailed theoretical solution to this problem has yet to be given.},

abstract = {The highest resolution (pixel scale 30 km) images of Ceres to date have been acquired by the Advanced Camera for Surveys onboard Hubble Space Telescope, through three wide band filters, centered at 535, 335, and 223 nm, covering more than one rotation of Ceres. The lightcurve at 535 nm agrees with earlier observations at V-band [Tedesco, E.F., Taylor, R.C., Drummond, J., Harwood, D., Nickoloff, I., Scaltriti, F., Schober, H. J., Zappala, V., 1983. Icarus 54, 23–29] in terms of magnitude, amplitude, and shape. The 0.04 magnitude lightcurve amplitude cannot be matched by Ceres’ rotationally symmetric shape, and is modeled here by albedo patterns. The geometric albedos at the above three wavelengths are measured to be 0.087±0.003, 0.056±0.002, and 0.039±0.003, respectively. V-band geometric albedo is calculated to be 0.090±0.003, consistent with earlier observations [Tedesco, E.F., 1989. In: Binzel, R.P., Gehrels, T., Matthews, M.S. (Eds.), Asteroids II. Univ. of Arizona Press, Tucson, pp. 1090–1138]. A strong absorption band (30\%) centered at about 280 nm is observed, but cannot be identified with either laboratory UV spectra or the spectra of Europa or Ganymede. The single-scattering albedo has been modeled to be 0.070±0.002, 0.046±0.002, and 0.032±0.003, respectively. The photometric roughness of Ceres’ surface is found to be about 44◦ ±5◦ from photometric modeling using Hapke’s theory, consistent with earlier radar observations [Mitchell, D.L., Ostro, S.J., Hudson, R.S., Rosema, K.D., Campbell, D.B., Velez, R., Chandler, J. F., Shapiro, I.I., Giorgini, J.D., Yeomans, D.K., 1996. Icarus 124, 113–133]. The first spatially resolved surface albedo maps of Ceres at three wavelengths have been constructed from HST observations, as well as the corresponding color maps. Eleven surface albedo features are identified, ranging in scale from 40–350 km. Overall the range of these albedo and color variations is small compared to other asteroids and some icy satellites. ©},

@article{Loizeau2007,
abstract = {OMEGA/Mars Express has discovered large outcrops rich in phyllosilicates in the region of Mawrth Vallis, Mars (around 20?W, 25?N). The region is located in Noachian highly cratered terrains, close to the limit of the Martian dichotomy, where the outflow channel Mawrth Vallis cuts the highlands. We have examined this region using OMEGA spectra of the surface from 0.9 umto2.6 um, with spatial sampling from 500 m to 3 km, offering a full coverage of the region. OMEGA spectra show two broad bands centered at 1 um and 2.2 um, revealing the presence of clinopyroxene on dark surfaces. Phyllosilicates have been identified by absorption bands at 1.4 um, 1.9 um, and 2.2 or 2.3 um. Comparison with laboratory spectra reveals similarities with Al-OH smectites such as montmorillonites, or Fe- or Mg-OH smectites such as nontronite. A precise location of the phyllosilicate-rich areas on visible HRSC images indicates that they are placed exclusively on bright outcrops, mostly on the plateaus, dated to the Noachian period. On HRSC and MOC images the phyllosilicate-rich outcrops reveal strong erosional features such as numerous residual buttes composed of layers a few meters thick. The phyllosilicate-rich unit corresponds to a geological unit more than 100 m thick, over a horizontal extension approximately of 300 km ? 400 km. This unit implies a large volume of altered rocks, either in situ or after transport and deposition, in Noachian terrains, revealing a different climatic and geologic environment from the present one.},

abstract = {The vertical distribution of water vapor is key to the study of Mars' hydrological cycle. To date, it has been explored mainly through global climate models because of a lack of direct measurements. However, these models assume the absence of supersaturation in the atmosphere of Mars. Here, we report observations made using the SPICAM (Spectroscopy for the Investigation of the Characteristics of the Atmosphere of Mars) instrument onboard Mars Express that provide evidence of the frequent presence of water vapor in excess of saturation, by an amount far surpassing that encountered in Earth's atmosphere. This result contradicts the widespread assumption that atmospheric water on Mars cannot exist in a supersaturated state, directly affecting our long-term representation of water transport, accumulation, escape, and chemistry on a global scale.},

We compare the results from this model with the standard chronology for the Moon showing their similarities and discrepancies. In particular, we find indications of a non-constant impactor flux in the last 500 Myr and also discuss the implications of our findings for the Late Heavy Bombardment hypothesis. We also show the potential of our model for accurate dating of other inner Solar System bodies, by applying it to Mercury.},

abstract = {During MESSENGER's first flyby of Mercury, the Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer made simultaneous mid-ultraviolet to near-infrared (wavelengths of 200 to 1300 nanometers) reflectance observations of the surface. An ultraviolet absorption (<280 nanometers) suggests that the ferrous oxide (Fe2+) content of silicates in average surface material is low (less than 2 to 3 weight percent). This result is supported by the lack of a detectable 1-micrometer Fe2+ absorption band in high-spatial-resolution spectra of mature surface materials as well as immature crater ejecta, which suggests that the ferrous iron content may be low both on the surface and at depth. Differences in absorption features and slope among the spectra are evidence for variations in composition and regolith maturation of Mercury's surface.},

@article{McCord2005,
abstract = {We modeled several thermal evolution scenarios for Ceres to explore the nature of large, wet protoplanets and to predict current-day evidence that might be found by close inspection, such as by the Dawn mission. The density for Ceres is near 2.1, suggesting a water content between 17\% and 27\% by mass. Short- and long-lived radioactive nuclide heating is considered. Even if only long-lived radionuclide heating is assumed, the water ice in Ceres melts quickly and a water mantle forms, but an approximately 10-km crust does not melt. The circulating warm water would alter the silicates. As heat is lost by conduction through the frozen crust, water begins to freeze out at the base of the crust. Solid-state convection begins and transports more heat as well as perhaps material dissolved or entrained in the water to or near the surface. Ceres’ water layer eventually (but perhaps not entirely) freezes, forming a layered density structure with perhaps some liquid water remaining today. Our differentiated models are in agreement with the recently measured difference between the equatorial and polar radii. We find that Ceres’ existence and evolution depend critically on it containing water at formation, and this depends strongly on the combination of when it accreted and the amount of 26Al present in the pre-Ceres ?1-km-sized objects; slightly more 26Al or earlier accretion produces a dry Vesta-like object. Melting and freezing plus mineralization would lead to several dimensional changes over time, creating topographic features, zones of weakness, and perhaps disruptions in the crust. Citation:},

@article{McDunn2013,
abstract = {[1] We characterize middle-atmosphere polar warming (PW) using nearly three martian years of temperature observations by Mars Climate Sounder. We report the observed structure of PW and share hypotheses as to possible explanations, which have yet to be tested with global dynamical models. In the data, PW manifested between p = 15 Pa and p = 4.8 × 10−3 Pa. The latitude where PW maximized shifted poleward with decreasing pressure. The nightside magnitude was larger than the dayside magnitude. The maximum nightside magnitudes ranged from 22 to 67 K. As expected, the annual maximum magnitude in the north occurred during late-local fall to mid-local winter. In the south it occurred during late-local winter. Also as expected, the maximum magnitude near MY 28's southern winter solstice was smaller than that at that same year's northern winter solstice, when a global dust storm was occurring. Unexpectedly, the maximum magnitude at southern winter solstice was comparable to that at northern winter solstice for both MY 29 and MY 30, years that did not experience global dust storms but certainly experienced greater dust loading during Ls 270° than Ls 90°. Another unexpected result was a hemispheric asymmetry in PW magnitude during most of the observed equinoxes. This paper also provides tables of (1) averaged temperatures as a function of latitude, pressure, and season, and (2) the maximum polar warming features as a function of pressure and season. These tables can be used to validate GCM calculations of middle-atmosphere temperatures and constrain calculations of unobserved winds.},

abstract = {Water probably flowed across ancient Mars, but whether it ever exists as a liquid on the surface today remains debatable. Recurring slope lineae (RSL) are narrow (0.5 to 5 meters), relatively dark markings on steep (25° to 40°) slopes; repeat images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment show them to appear and incrementally grow during warm seasons and fade in cold seasons. They extend downslope from bedrock outcrops, often associated with small channels, and hundreds of them form in some rare locations. RSL appear and lengthen in the late southern spring and summer from 48°S to 32°S latitudes favoring equator-facing slopes, which are times and places with peak surface temperatures from \~{}250 to 300 kelvin. Liquid brines near the surface might explain this activity, but the exact mechanism and source of water are not understood.},

abstract = {We present new photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Pluto-Charon system carried out at the VLT-ESO (Chile) with two 8-meter telescopes equipped with the FORS2, ISAAC and SINFONI instruments. The spectra were obtained in the 0.6-2.45$\mu$m range with a spectral resolution from 300 to 1500. The SINFONI data were obtained using Adaptive Optics, allowing a complete separation of the two bodies. We derive both objects’ magnitudes in the near infrared and convert them into albedo values. These first near infrared photometric data allow to adjust the different parts of Pluto’s spectrum, provided by the three instruments. We run spectral models in order to give chemical and physical constraints on the surface of Pluto and Charon. We discuss the dilution properties of the methane ice and its implications on Pluto’s surface. The heterogeneities of the pure and diluted methane ice on Pluto’s surface is also investigated. The high signal-to-noise level of the data and our analyses may support the presence of ethane ice on the surface of Pluto, which is one of the main products of the methane irradiation and photolysis. The analyses of the spectra of Charon suggest that the water ice is almost completely in its crystalline form and that the ammonia compound is hydrated on the surface of this satellite.},

@article{Morgan2010,
abstract = {The Amazonian period of Mars has been described as static, cold, and dry. Recent analysis of high-resolution imagery of equatorial and mid-latitude regions have revealed an array of young landforms produced in association with ice and liquid water; because near-surface ice in these regions is currently unstable, these ice-and-water-related landforms suggest one or more episodes of martian climate change during the Amazonian. Here we report on the origin and evolution of valley systems within a degraded crater in Noachis Terra, Asimov crater. The valleys have produced a unique environment in which to study the geomorphic signals of Amazonian climate change. New high-resolution images reveal Hesperian-aged layered basalt with distinctive columnar jointing capping interior crater fill and providing debris, via mass wasting, for the surrounding annular valleys. The occurrence of steep slopes (>20°), relatively narrow (sheltered) valleys, and a source of debris have provided favorable conditions for the preservation of shallow-ice deposits. Detailed mapping reveals morphological evidence for viscous ice flow, in the form of several lobate debris tongues (LDT). Superimposed on LDT are a series of fresh-appearing gullies, with typical alcove, channel, and fan morphologies. The shift from ice-rich viscous-flow formation to gully erosion is best explained as a shift in martian climate, from one compatible with excess snowfall and flow of ice-rich deposits, to one consistent with minor snow and gully formation. Available dating suggests that the climate transition occurred >8 Ma, prior to the formation of other small scale ice-rich flow features identified elsewhere on Mars that have been interpreted to have formed during the most recent phases of high obliquity. Taken together, these older deposits suggest that multiple climatic shifts have occurred over the last tens of millions of years of martian history.},

abstract = {Decades of speculation about a warmer, wetter Mars climate in the planet's first billion years postulate a denser CO2-rich atmosphere than at present. Such an atmosphere should have led to the formation of outcrops rich in carbonate minerals, for which evidence has been sparse. Using the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit, we have now identified outcrops rich in magnesium-iron carbonate (16 to 34 weight percent) in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater. Its composition approximates the average composition of the carbonate globules in martian meteorite ALH 84001. The Gusev carbonate probably precipitated from carbonate-bearing solutions under hydrothermal conditions at near-neutral pH in association with volcanic activity during the Noachian era.},

abstract = {The Hayabusa spacecraft successfully recovered dust particles from the surface of near-Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa. Synchrotron-radiation x-ray diffraction and transmission and scanning electron microscope analyses indicate that the mineralogy and mineral chemistry of the Itokawa dust particles are identical to those of thermally metamorphosed LL chondrites, consistent with spectroscopic observations made from Earth and by the Hayabusa spacecraft. Our results directly demonstrate that ordinary chondrites, the most abundant meteorites found on Earth, come from S-type asteroids. Mineral chemistry indicates that the majority of regolith surface particles suffered long-term thermal annealing and subsequent impact shock, suggesting that Itokawa is an asteroid made of reassembled pieces of the interior portions of a once larger asteroid.},

@book{Obe2011,
abstract = {PostGIS is a spatial database extender for the PostgreSQL Open Source Object-Relational database management system. PostGIS follows the OGC/SQL-MM standards. PostGIS in Action is a comprehensive book about PostGIS that will guide you thru many of the basic and advanced features of this fast, feature-rich spatial database. It is an excellent companion book to the already excellent PostGIS reference manuals. While the book is useful for lower versions of PostGIS and PostgreSQL, our main target is PostGIS 1.5+ and PostgreSQL 8.4+. Some of the examples use features introduced in PostgreSQL 8.4+ and PostGIS 1.5. Along the way we will also be detailing features in the beta or pipeline features of later PostGIS and PostgreSQL 9.0. We'll introduce you to both PostGIS as well as PostgreSQL, the powerful DBMS that PostGIS spatially extends.

@article{Ockert-Bell2010,
abstract = {We have conducted a radar-driven observational campaign of 22 main-belt asteroids (MBAs) focused on Bus-DeMeo Xc- and Xk-type objects (Tholen X and M class asteroids) using the Arecibo radar and NASA Infrared Telescope Facilities (IRTF). Sixteen of our targets were near-simultaneously observed with radar and those observations are described in a companion paper (Shepard et al., 2010). We find that most of the highest metal-content asteroids, as suggested by radar, tend to exhibit silicate absorption features at both 0.9 and 1.9 $\mu$m, and the lowest metal-content asteroids tend to exhibit either no bands or only the 0.9 $\mu$m band. Eleven of the asteroids were observed at several rotational longitudes in the near-infrared and significant variations in continuum slope were found for nine in the spectral regions 1.1-1.45 $\mu$m and 1.6-2.3 $\mu$m. We utilized visible wavelength data (Bus and Binzel, 2002b; Fornasier et al. 2010) for a more complete compositional analysis of our targets. Compositional evidence is derived from our target asteroid spectra using two different methods: 1) a $\chi$2 search for spectral matches in the RELAB database, and 2) parametric comparisons with meteorites. This paper synthesizes the results of the RELAB search and the parametric comparisons with compositional suggestions based on radar observations. We find that for six of the seven asteroids with the highest iron abundances, our spectral results are consistent with the radar evidence (16 Psyche, 216 Kleopatra, 347 Pariana, 758 Mancunia, 779 Nina, and 785 Zwetana). Three of the seven asteroids with the lowest metal abundances, our spectral results are consistent with the radar evidence (21 Lutetia, 135 Hertha, 497 Iva). The remaining seven asteroids (22 Kalliope, 97 Klotho, 110 Lydia, 129 Antigone, 224 Oceana, 678 Fredegundis, and 771 Libera) have ambiguous compositional interpretations when comparing the spectral analogs to the radar analogs. The number of objects with ambiguous results from this multi-wavelength survey using visible, near-infrared, and radar wavelengths indicates that perhaps a third diagnostic wavelength region (such as the mid-infrared around 2-4 $\mu$m, the mid-infrared around 10-15 $\mu$m, and/or the ultraviolet around 0.2-0.4 $\mu$m) should be explored to resolve the discrepancies.},

@phdthesis{Piccialli2010,
abstract = {The dynamics of Venus mesosphere was investigated by using observations from the Venus Express (VEx) mission. In the frame of this work, zonal thermal winds were derived from the VIRTIS (Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer) and VeRa (Radio Science Experiment) temperature soundings by applying a special approximation of the thermal wind equation, the cyclostrophic balance. Thanks to Venus Express capabilities, the variability of zonal wind with latitude, altitude and local time was analysed in detail. The main features of the retrieved winds are: (1) the midlatitude jet with a maximum speed up to 140 ± 15 m s­¹ which occurs around 50°S latitude at 70 km altitude; (2) the fast decrease of the wind speed from 60°S toward the pole; (3) the decrease of the wind speed with increasing height above the jet. Thermal winds were compared to the cloud-tracked winds derived from the Venus Monitoring Camera (VMC/VEx) UV images that allowed to validate the cyclostrophic assumption. From the temperature and thermal wind fields we calculated the Richardson number, the parameter characterising the stability of the atmosphere. We have found that the atmosphere is dominated by convection from \~{}45 km altitude up to the cloud top. High values of Richardson number in the region of midlatitude jet indicate highly stable atmosphere. Verification of the necessary condition for barotropic instability implies that it can occur on the poleward side of the midlatitude jet where planetary waves are expected to play an important role in the maintenance of the circulation.},

@article{Pieters2009,
abstract = {The search for water on the surface of the anhydrous Moon had remained an unfulfilled quest for 40 years. However, the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) on Chandrayaan-1 has recently detected absorption features near 2.8 to 3.0 micrometers on the surface of the Moon. For silicate bodies, such features are typically attributed to hydroxyl- and/or water-bearing materials. On the Moon, the feature is seen as a widely distributed absorption that appears strongest at cooler high latitudes and at several fresh feldspathic craters. The general lack of correlation of this feature in sunlit M3 data with neutron spectrometer hydrogen abundance data suggests that the formation and retention of hydroxyl and water are ongoing surficial processes. Hydroxyl/water production processes may feed polar cold traps and make the lunar regolith a candidate source of volatiles for human exploration.},

abstract = {A line-heat source apparatus was assembled for the purpose of measuring thermal conductivities of particulate samples under low pressures of a carbon dioxide atmosphere. The primary result of this project is the compilation of the first comprehensive suite of measurements of the dependence of thermal conductivity on particle size. The thermal conductivity increases with increasing particle size and atmospheric pressure. In particular, over the range of Martian atmospheric pressures, from 1 to 7 torr, the thermal conductivity was found to be empirically related to approximately the square root of the particle diameter and the square of the cubed root of the atmospheric pressure. At the average pressure of the Martian surface (6 torr) the thermal conductivity varies from 0.011 W/m K, for particles less than 11 $\mu$m in diameter, to 0.11 W/m K, for particles 900 $\mu$m in diameter. These results differ significantly from the particle size dependence estimated for Mars from previous measurements, except for 200-$\mu$m particles, whose thermal conductivity is 0.053 W/m K. The thermal conductivities of larger particles are lower than the previous estimate, by 40\% at 900 $\mu$m, and the thermal conductivities of smaller particles are higher than the previous estimate, by 60\% at 11 $\mu$m. These newer estimates agree with other lines of evidence from Martian atmospheric and surficial processes and lead to improved particle size estimates for most of the planet's surface.},

abstract = {Multispectral images (0.44 to 0.98 $\mu$m) of asteroid (4) Vesta obtained by the Dawn Framing Cameras reveal global color variations that uncover and help understand the north-south hemispherical dichotomy. The signature of deep lithologies excavated during the formation of the Rheasilvia basin on the south pole has been preserved on the surface. Color variations (band depth, spectral slope, and eucrite-diogenite abundance) clearly correlate with distinct compositional units. Vesta displays the greatest variation of geometric albedo (0.10 to 0.67) of any asteroid yet observed. Four distinct color units are recognized that chronicle processes--including impact excavation, mass wasting, and space weathering--that shaped the asteroid's surface. Vesta's color and photometric diversity are indicative of its status as a preserved, differentiated protoplanet.},

A higher-reflectance, relatively red material occurs as a distinct class of smooth plains that were likely emplaced volcanically; a lower-reflectance material with a lesser spectral slope may represent a distinct crustal component enriched in opaque minerals, possibly more common at depth. A spectrally intermediate terrain probably forms most of the upper crust. Three other spectrally distinct but spatially restricted units include fresh crater ejecta less affected by space weathering than other surface materials; high-reflectance deposits seen in some crater floors; and moderately high-reflectance, relatively reddish material associated with rimless depressions.},

abstract = {Cluster analysis is aimed at classifying elements into categories on the basis of their similarity. Its applications range from astronomy to bioinformatics, bibliometrics, and pattern recognition. We propose an approach based on the idea that cluster centers are characterized by a higher density than their neighbors and by a relatively large distance from points with higher densities. This idea forms the basis of a clustering procedure in which the number of clusters arises intuitively, outliers are automatically spotted and excluded from the analysis, and clusters are recognized regardless of their shape and of the dimensionality of the space in which they are embedded. We demonstrate the power of the algorithm on several test cases.},

abstract = {The Dawn spacecraft targeted 4 Vesta, believed to be a remnant intact protoplanet from the earliest epoch of solar system formation, based on analyses of howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) meteorites that indicate a differentiated parent body. Dawn observations reveal a giant basin at Vesta's south pole, whose excavation was sufficient to produce Vesta-family asteroids (Vestoids) and HED meteorites. The spatially resolved mineralogy of the surface reflects the composition of the HED meteorites, confirming the formation of Vesta's crust by melting of a chondritic parent body. Vesta's mass, volume, and gravitational field are consistent with a core having an average radius of 107 to 113 kilometers, indicating sufficient internal melting to segregate iron. Dawn's results confirm predictions that Vesta differentiated and support its identification as the parent body of the HEDs.},

abstract = {Dawn's global mapping of Vesta reveals that its observed south polar depression is composed of two overlapping giant impact features. These large basins provide exceptional windows into impact processes at planetary scales. The youngest, Rheasilvia, is 500 kilometers wide and 19 kilometers deep and finds its nearest morphologic analog among large basins on low-gravity icy satellites. Extensive ejecta deposits occur, but impact melt volume is low, exposing an unusual spiral fracture pattern that is likely related to faulting during uplift and convergence of the basin floor. Rheasilvia obliterated half of another 400-kilometer-wide impact basin, Veneneia. Both basins are unexpectedly young, roughly 1 to 2 billion years, and their formation substantially reset Vestan geology and excavated sufficient volumes of older compositionally heterogeneous crustal material to have created the Vestoids and howardite-eucrite-diogenite meteorites.},

abstract = {The polar condensation/sublimation of CO2, that involve about one fourth of the atmosphere mass, is the major Martian climatic cycle. Early observations in visible and thermal infrared have shown that the sublimation of the Seasonal South Polar Cap (SSPC) is not symmetric around the geographic South Pole. Here we use observations by OMEGA/Mars Express in the near-infrared to detect unambiguously the presence of CO2 at the surface, and to estimate albedo. Second, we estimate the sublimation of CO2 released in the atmosphere and show that there is a two-step process. From Ls=180\{$\backslash$deg\} to 220\{$\backslash$deg\}, the sublimation is nearly symmetric with a slight advantage for the cryptic region. After Ls=220\{$\backslash$deg\} the anti-cryptic region sublimation is stronger. Those two phases are not balanced such that there is 22\% +/- 9 more mass the anti-cryptic region, arguing for more snow precipitation. We compare those results with the MOLA height measurements. Finally we discuss implications for the Martian atmosphere about general circulation and gas tracers, e.g. Ar.},

abstract = {We used Mars Express HRSC and OMEGA data to investigate mesospheric cloud features observed in the equatorial belt of Mars from December 2007 until early March 2008. This period corresponds to early northern spring of Martian year 29. The reflection peak at 4.26 µm in OMEGA data identifies the clouds as CO 2 ice clouds. HRSC observed the clouds together with OMEGA in five orbits. Cloud features are most prominent in the shortwave HRSC colour channels with wavelength centers at 440 nm and 530 nm, but rarely visible in all other channels. In the period of Ls 0°-36°, OMEGA and HRSC together detected mesospheric CO 2 ice clouds in 40 orbits. They occur in a latitude belt of ±20° around the equator and at longitudes between 240°E (Tharsis) in the West and 30°E (Sinus Meridiani) in the East. The clouds were observed between 3 pm and 5 pm local time with mainly ripple-like to filamentary cloud forms. The viewing angles of the HRSC blue and green colour channels differ by 6.6° and the resulting parallax can be used to directly measure cloud heights by means of ray intersection. 17 HRSC data takes were found to exhibit clouds with heights from 66 km to 83 km with an accuracy of 1-2 km. The pushbroom imaging technique also yields a time delay for the two observations in the order of 5 to 15 seconds close to periapsis, and therefore time-related cloud movements can be detected. A method was developed to determine the across-track cloud displacements, which can directly be translated to wind velocities. Zonal cloud movements could be measured in 13 cases and were oriented from East to West. Related wind speeds range between 60-93 m/s with an accuracy of 10-13 m/s.},
annote = {[5] Conclusion and outlook[...] The small along-track stereo angle between these sensors allows for the determination of the altitude of single features with an absolute accuracy of 1–2 km and an additional 0.7 km uncertainty for each 10 m/s along-track (North–South) movement. [...] In addition, the time delay between data from both sensors allows for the determination of across-track (East–West) velocity components with an accuracy of about 10–13 m/s. The measurement results locate cloud features in altitudes of 66–83 km with a mean of 75 km. The detected East–West velocity range is 60–93 m/s with a mean of 73 m/s. When OMEGA was operating in parallel, the spectral CO2 ice signatures around 4.26 µm could clearly be related to the HRSC measurements.The two instruments onboard Mars Express encountered high-altitude CO2 ice clouds in 40 orbits during a period in Martian year 29 covering Ls 0° to Ls 36°. Nearly all detections occur within an area ranging from the Tharsis region to Sinus Meridiani at longitudes between 240°E and 30°E and at latitudes below 20° around the equator. The prevailing cloud morphologies as revealed by HRSC imagery are ripple-like or filamentary forms and modelling studies are needed to better understand the processes involved in the formation and dissipation of mesospheric clouds.

abstract = {The time histogram method is the most basic tool for capturing a time dependent rate of neuronal spikes. Generally in the neurophysiological literature, the bin size that critically determines the goodness of the fit of the time histogram to the underlying spike rate has been subjectively selected by individual researchers. Here, we propose a method for objectively selecting the bin size from the spike count statistics alone, so that the resulting bar or line graph time histogram best represents the unknown underlying spike rate. For a small number of spike sequences generated from a modestly fluctuating rate, the optimal bin size may diverge, indicating that any time histogram is likely to capture a spurious rate. Given a paucity of data, the method presented here can nevertheless suggest how many experimental trials should be added in order to obtain a meaningful time-dependent histogram with the required accuracy.},

abstract = {Kernel smoother and a time-histogram are classical tools for estimating an instantaneous rate of spike occurrences. We recently established a method for selecting the bin width of the time-histogram, based on the principle of minimizing the mean integrated square error (MISE) between the estimated rate and unknown underlying rate. Here we apply the same optimization principle to the kernel density estimation in selecting the width or "bandwidth" of the kernel, and further extend the algorithm to allow a variable bandwidth, in conformity with data. The variable kernel has the potential to accurately grasp non-stationary phenomena, such as abrupt changes in the firing rate, which we often encounter in neuroscience. In order to avoid possible overfitting that may take place due to excessive freedom, we introduced a stiffness constant for bandwidth variability. Our method automatically adjusts the stiffness constant, thereby adapting to the entire set of spike data. It is revealed that the classical kernel smoother may exhibit goodness-of-fit comparable to, or even better than, that of modern sophisticated rate estimation methods, provided that the bandwidth is selected properly for a given set of spike data, according to the optimization methods presented here.},

abstract = {Radio tracking of the MESSENGER spacecraft has provided a model of Mercury's gravity field. In the northern hemisphere, several large gravity anomalies, including candidate mass concentrations (mascons), exceed 100 milli-Galileos (mgal). Mercury's northern hemisphere crust is thicker at low latitudes and thinner in the polar region and shows evidence for thinning beneath some impact basins. The low-degree gravity field, combined with planetary spin parameters, yields the moment of inertia C/MR(2) = 0.353 ± 0.017, where M and R are Mercury's mass and radius, and a ratio of the moment of inertia of Mercury's solid outer shell to that of the planet of C(m)/C = 0.452 ± 0.035. A model for Mercury's radial density distribution consistent with these results includes a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid iron-sulfide layer and an iron-rich liquid outer core and perhaps a solid inner core.},

abstract = {A procedure was developed for analyzing remote reflectance spectra, including multispectral images, that quantifies parameters such as types of mineral mixtures, the abundances of mixed minerals, and particle sizes. Principal components analysis reduced the spectral dimensionality and allowed testing the uniqueness and validity of spectral mixing models. By analyzing variations in the overall spectral reflectance curves, the type of spectral mixture was identified, mineral abundances quantified and the effects of particle size identified. The results demonstrate an advantage in classification accuracy over classical forms of analysis that ignore effects of particle-size or mineral-mixture systematics on spectra. The approach is applicable to remote sensing data of planetary surfaces for quantitative determinations of mineral abundances.},

The MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission is designed to answer many of the questions raised during the brief encounters of Mariner 10 with Mercury in 1974 and 1975, and by innovative ground-based telescopic observations and discoveries made over the past two decades. The planned launch date is March, 2004 and the first encounter with Mercury is scheduled for July, 2007. Of particular interest are detailed observations of planetary figure and librations, geologic history, volatiles stored in high latitude craters (polar ices?), evidence for volcanism, trace constituents in the thin atmosphere, Mercury's magnetosphere, and its interaction with the solar wind. The European Space Agency (ESA) is planning a mission to Mercury for the next decade: Bepi Colombo.},

abstract = {Morphologies and size-frequency distributions of impact craters on Mercury imaged during MESSENGER's first flyby elucidate the planet's geological history. Plains interior to the Caloris basin displaying color and albedo contrasts have comparable crater densities and therefore similar ages. Smooth plains exterior to Caloris exhibit a crater density approximately 40\% less than on interior plains and are thus volcanic and not Caloris impact ejecta. The size distribution of smooth-plains craters matches that of lunar craters postdating the Late Heavy Bombardment, implying that the plains formed no earlier than 3.8 billion years ago (Ga). At diameters less than or equal to 8 to 10 kilometers, secondary impact craters on Mercury are more abundant than primaries; this transition diameter is much larger than that on the Moon or Mars. A low density of craters on the peak-ring basin Raditladi implies that it may be younger than 1 Ga.},

Hydroxyl (OH) and water (H2O) absorptions in the near infrared were strongest near the North Pole and are consistent with <0.5 weight percent H2O. Hydration varied with temperature, rather than cumulative solar radiation, but no inherent absorptivity differences with composition were observed. However, comparisons between data collected 1 week (a quarter lunar day) apart show a dynamic process with diurnal changes in hydration that were greater for mare basalts (approximately 70\%) than for highlands (approximately 50\%). This hydration loss and return to a steady state occurred entirely between local morning and evening, requiring a ready daytime source of water-group ions, which is consistent with a solar wind origin.},

@article{Sunshine1993a,
abstract = {Olivine was remotely identified as a major component on many S- and A-type asteroids based on qualitative analyses of broad absorption features near 1.0 micron in their telescopic reflectance spectra. Laboratory studies showed that this diagnostic olivine absorption feature is composed of three individual absorption bands resulting from electronic transitions of Fe(+2) in distorted M1 and M2 sites. Both the overall absorption feature and each of the individual absorption bands are also known to vary systematically as a function of olivine composition. Thus, it should be possible to remotely determine the composition of olivine present on the surfaces of the various olivine-rich asteroids. However, extrapolation of laboratory studies to compositional interpretation of asteroid spectra is complicated by several factors: observational noise; lower spectral resolution; compositional heterogeneities (including the presence of other phases such as pyroxenes and/or metal); and the effects of alteration processes. In order to address such complex problems, a quantitative approach to spectral analysis, the modified Gaussian model (MGM) was developed by Sunshine et al., which deconvolves spectra into their constituent absorption bands. The MGM, a refinement of the Gaussian model, more accurately adheres to the physical processes involved in electronic transition absorptions. Under the MGM, each spectrum is modeled in log reflectance and energy as a sum of absorption bands superimposed onto a baseline or continuum. Each absorption band is described by three model parameters (center, width, and strength) which can be interpreted and used to infer composition. One of the strengths of the MGM is that it allows compositional information to be extracted directly from measured spectra and is therefore complementary to other approaches to modeling asteroid spectra which require the use of meteorites and/or terrestrial samples as spectral analogs. A quantitative understanding of the properties of olivine absorptions was established by using the MGM to analyze a laboratory suite of spectra spanning a full range of olivine compositions.},

abstract = {Organics are expected to exist on Mars based on meteorite infall, in situ production, and any possible biological sources. Yet they have not been detected on the martian surface; are they there, or are we not capable enough to detect them? The Viking gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer did not detect organics in the headspace of heated soil samples with a detection limit of parts per billion. This null result strongly influenced the interpretation of the reactivity seen in the Viking biology experiments and led to the conclusion that life was not present and, instead, that there was some chemical reactivity in the soil. The detection of perchlorates in the martian soil by instruments on the Phoenix lander and the reports of methane in the martian atmosphere suggest that it may be time to reconsider the question of organics. The high-temperature oxidizing properties of perchlorate will promote combustion of organics in pyrolytic experiments and may have affected the ability of both Phoenix's organic analysis experiment and the Viking mass spectrometer experiments to detect organics. So the question of organics on Mars remains open. A primary focus of the upcoming Mars Science Laboratory will be the detection and identification of organic molecules by means of thermal volatilization, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry--as was done on Viking. However, to enhance organic detectability, some of the samples will be processed with liquid derivatization agents that will dissolve organics from the soil before pyrolysis, which may separate them from the soil perchlorates. Nonetheless, the problem of organics on Mars is not solved, and for future missions other organic detection techniques should therefore be considered as well.},

@article{VanStokkum2004,
abstract = {In biological/bioenergetics research the response of a complex system to an externally applied perturbation is often studied. Spectroscopic measurements at multiple wavelengths are used to monitor the kinetics. These time-resolved spectra are considered as an example of multiway data. In this paper, the methodology for global and target analysis of time-resolved spectra is reviewed. To fully extract the information from the overwhelming amount of data, a model-based analysis is mandatory. This analysis is based upon assumptions regarding the measurement process and upon a physicochemical model for the complex system. This model is composed of building blocks representing scientific knowledge and assumptions. Building blocks are the instrument response function (IRF), the components of the system connected in a kinetic scheme, and anisotropy properties of the components. The combination of a model for the kinetics and for the spectra of the components results in a more powerful spectrotemporal model. The model parameters, like rate constants and spectra, can be estimated from the data, thus providing a concise description of the complex system dynamics. This spectrotemporal modeling approach is illustrated with an elaborate case study of the ultrafast dynamics of the photoactive yellow protein.},

abstract = {The properties of Mercury's regolith have been investigated at optical and near-infrared wavelengths with high-resolution imaging, photometric, and spectroscopic observations with the Swedish Vacuum Solar Telescope and the Nordic Optical Telescope. A new global optical map at a spatial resolution of 200 km shows that the well known (from Mariner 10) and poorly known hemispheres are indistinguishable with respect to the distribution, number density, and morphological parameters of bright albedo features. This indicates a globally uniform recent (<3 Gyr) geologic evolution, a compositionally very homogeneous surface and the absence of a lunar-like mare–terrae albedo dichotomy.It is found that the spectrum of Mercury is linear, strongly sloped, lacks detectable absorption features and displays a unique relation between the continuum slope and photometric geometry. Mercury has a photometrically smoother surface than the average near-side Moon, and is 10–15\% fainter and 50\% more back scattering in the V-band. Unlike the case for the Moon, the average single-particle backscattering anisotropy increases with wavelength.Intimate regolith mixing models are used to determine a probable surface composition of predominantly Ca-rich labradorite plagioclase feldspar with minor low-iron enstatitic orthopyroxene, and rule out high-iron pyroxenes or olivines as other than insignificant constituents. Abundances of FeO \~{}1.2 wt\%, TiO2 \~{}0 wt\%, and submicroscopic metallic iron \~{}0.1–0.3 wt\% are found for the average surface. This implies an optically active grain size of 15–30 $\mu$m that is a factor of two smaller than for the Moon.A numerical integration study shows that hermeocentric orbits with semi-major axes <30 mercurian radii for elliptic retrograde, and circular prograde, object are stable for durations in excess of 4.5 Myr. The weak gravitational scattering effect of Mercury indicates that re-impacting particles may have been important for the early evolution of its crust.},

The Rembrandt basin is comparable in age to the Caloris basin, is partially flooded by volcanic plains, and displays a unique wheel-and-spoke-like pattern of basin-radial and basin-concentric wrinkle ridges and graben. Stratigraphic relations indicate a multistaged infilling and deformational history involving successive or overlapping phases of contractional and extensional deformation. The youngest deformation of the basin involved the formation of a approximately 1000-kilometer-long lobate scarp, a product of the global cooling and contraction of Mercury.},

abstract = {With the goal of improving our understanding of how small mineral dust particles scatter light at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, we measured the scattering phase function and linear polarization of small mineral dust particles over the scattering angle range 15°–170° at three wavelengths (0.47, 0.652, and 0.937 $\mu$m). Particle samples were obtained from Duke Scientific Corp., and include aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, aluminum silicate, antimony oxide, calcium carbonate, and cerium oxide. Particle equivalent-sphere radii range from a few tenths of a micron to about 10 $\mu$m. The particles were injected into a laboratory chamber, where they scattered light as they fell through the air. They were collected on a scanning electron micrograph (SEM) substrate. Particle shapes and sizes were then measured from the SEM images. We compare measured phase functions with those calculated for spheroids with a distribution of axial ratios and sizes, random orientation, and refractive index 1.53 + 0.008i [Mishchenko et al., this issue]. Two of the samples (one of which has a refractive index close to that used in theoretical computations) produced scattering phase functions that were quite similar to those for spheroids. Two samples produced phase functions whose variation between 15° and 170° was much less than that for the spheroids or for the other samples. We suspect this difference may be due to the very high refractive index of those particles, although differences in particle microstructure may also be important. Two samples produced positive linear polarization which had a single broad maximum near 100° scattering angle, and a magnitude greater than 40\% at some wavelengths. Two samples had generally positive linear polarization but a more complicated structure, and two samples produced mostly negative polarization whose amplitude was small. We do not have numerical results for the appropriate refractive index and size parameter with which to compare the polarization measurements. We hope the questions raised by this work will stimulate additional effort to develop and test numerical codes for scattering by nonspherical particles.},

abstract = {The light detection and ranging instrument on the Phoenix mission observed water-ice clouds in the atmosphere of Mars that were similar to cirrus clouds on Earth. Fall streaks in the cloud structure traced the precipitation of ice crystals toward the ground. Measurements of atmospheric dust indicated that the planetary boundary layer (PBL) on Mars was well mixed, up to heights of around 4 kilometers, by the summer daytime turbulence and convection. The water-ice clouds were detected at the top of the PBL and near the ground each night in late summer after the air temperature started decreasing. The interpretation is that water vapor mixed upward by daytime turbulence and convection forms ice crystal clouds at night that precipitate back toward the surface.},

@article{Whitten2014a,
abstract = {Orbital observations by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft are used to re-evaluate the nature and origin of the oldest mapped plains deposits on Mercury, the intercrater and intermediate plains units defined by Mariner 10 investigators. Despite the large areal extent of these plains, which comprise approximately one-third of the planetary surface area viewed by Mariner 10, their formation mechanism was not well constrained by Mariner 10 imaging. One hypothesis attributed plains formation to ponding of fluidized impact ejecta to create relatively smooth surfaces. Another hypothesis was that these plains are of volcanic origin. To assess the origin of these older plains and the contribution of early volcanism to resurfacing on Mercury, we have used MESSENGER data to analyze the morphology, spectral properties, impact crater statistics, and topography of Mariner 10 type-areas of intercrater and intermediate plains. On the basis of new criteria for the identification of intercrater and intermediate plains derived from these observations, we have remapped 18\% of the surface of Mercury. We find that the intercrater plains are a highly textured unit with an abundance of secondary craters, whereas the intermediate plains are composed of both intercrater and smooth plains. We suggest that the term “intermediate plains” not be used to map the surface of Mercury henceforth, but rather this unit should be subdivided into its constituent intercrater and smooth plains units. We argue that a substantial percentage of the intercrater plains are composed of volcanic materials on the basis of (1) examples of areas where ejecta from a small number of superposed craters have transformed smooth plains deposits of volcanic origin into a unit indistinguishable from intercrater plains; (2) the range in ages of intercrater plains deposits as interpreted from crater size-frequency distributions; and (3) the near-global distribution of intercrater plains compared with the uneven distribution of impact basins and their associated ejecta deposits.},
